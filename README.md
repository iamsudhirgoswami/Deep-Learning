# Bank Churn Prediction - Keras ANN 🏦

## 📌 Project Overview
This project utilizes **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** with Keras & TensorFlow to predict customer churn in the banking sector. The goal is to analyze customer data and identify individuals likely to leave the bank, enabling proactive customer retention strategies.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow & Keras**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pandas & NumPy**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains customer demographics, transaction history, and account details. Key features include:
- Credit score, age, tenure, balance, etc.
- Whether the customer has exited the bank (target variable)

## 🚀 Model Pipeline
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, encoding categorical data
2. **Building ANN**: Creating an ANN with input, hidden, and output layers
3. **Training & Evaluation**: Using accuracy and loss metrics to assess model performance

## 🔥 Results & Insights
- Achieved significant accuracy in predicting churn
- Feature importance analysis to understand key factors influencing customer decisions

## 📂 How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone [repository-link]
   cd bank-churn-ann
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the notebook or script:
   ```sh
   python bank_churn_model.py
   ```

## 💡 Future Enhancements
- Hyperparameter tuning for better performance
- Deploying the model using Flask or FastAPI
- Exploring alternative ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
